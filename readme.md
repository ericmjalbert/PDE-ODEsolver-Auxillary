# PDE-ODEsolver Auxillary Programs

## `batch-results`

This is the set of scripts that runs all the needed simulations.

## `error-calc`

This is how the error between solutions is computed.
Essentially an R script that has an accompanying BASH to run for all the different simulations.

## `gen-figures`

This is a series of gnuplot scripts ,`*.gnu`, that generate each figure in the thesis.
The BASH here runs all the gnuplot scripts.
